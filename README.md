# Simple-Anime-Recommendation-System
It's been awhile since my last repository and this one is kind of fun project. While I am in job hunting phase, I think I need to practice my skill in data. Therefore I have this idea to build simple anime recommendation system because I love watching anime. I have loved it since I was a little girl watching Sunday morning cartoon on tv. But these days, I will not watch all anime available now, which has reached thousands and even millions episodes. Getting older (and hopefully wiser) makes me picky for what anime to watch. So, I challenge myself to finish this independent project in a week, following tutorials from Purwadhika lectures, and reading articles. I named this project as 'simple' one because it only need one input, hopefully I can build something similar with more complexity.
